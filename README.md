This is the base app for [*Learn Enough Action Cable to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/action-cable-tutorial).

The base app doesn't use Action Cable, but rather is designed as the starting point for the tutorial. To see the state of the app at the *end* of the tutorial, switch to the `action-cable-reference` branch:

```
git checkout action-cable-reference
```

When following the tutorial, you should be able to resolve any discrepancies by comparing with this reference app.
